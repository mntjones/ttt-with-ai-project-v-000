# How to play TTT logically (from wikipedia)

#Win: If the player has two in a row, they can place a third to get three in a row.
#Block: If the opponent has two in a row, the player must play the third themselves to block the opponent.
#Fork: Create an opportunity where the player has two threats to win
#Blocking an opponentâ€™s fork
#Center: A player marks the center.
#Opposite corner: If the opponent is in the corner, the player plays the opposite corner.
#Empty corner: The player plays in a corner square.
#Empty side: The player plays in a middle square on any of the 4 sides.
